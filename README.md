G'day chads and welcome to IceNap, a joint project between 2 idiots from Iceland and Italy, we got the idea of making this website when we were thinking that maybe making an operating system would be a bit too difficult to make at the start, so we are going for something easier, for example: a bloging website!

The languages we are going to use are these:
- NodeJS
- Astro (as Frontend)
- Express (as Backend)
- MongoDB (as the Database)

What we want in this:
- A Reddit/Twitter like UI (although not decided on yet)
- Login/Signup functionality
- A database connection with users/posts
- small enough that I (Mr. Potts) could realistically host the website on my RPi3

What we are working on right now:
- Learning the Astro language
- Learning how to use Astro as frontend and Express as backend
